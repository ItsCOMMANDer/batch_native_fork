=== Features ===
- Fast
- Mouse and keyboard polling
 - Multiple keys down at once support
- Discord RPC
- Easy to setup in existing or new projects
- Small size (depending on chosen modules)

=== New environment variables ===
--- GetInput ---
(o) keyspressed*: is formatted like this: -keycode1-keycode2-keycode3-
(o) click: left=1,right=2
(o) wheeldelta***: up=-1,down=1
(o) mousexpos**
(o) mouseypos**
(i) noresize: 1 to disable resizing
(i) rasterx:  - optional: turn on the raster font and set its size to x and y
(i) rastery:  |

*    uses virtual key codes, not characters (raw input), keycode reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes
**   measured in characters
***  doesnt get reset automatically, reset it manually

-- DiscordRpc ---
(i) discordappid - your own app id (created on the discord developer portal)
(io)discordupdate - set this to anything when updating the rpc; gets nulled on update
(i) discordstate - state (for example "Editing main.c")
(i) discorddetails - details (for example "Line 50; column 100")
(i) discordlargeimg - name of the asset that gets used as the large image
(i) discordlargeimgtxt - text when user mouses over the large image
(i) discordsmallimg - name of the asset that gets used as the small image
(i) discordsmallimgtxt - text when user mouses over the small image

i=in,o=out

=== Example setup ===
--- GetInput ---
set /a mousexpos=mouseypos=keyspressed=click=wheeldelta=0 & :: Reset the variables
set /a rasterx=8,rastery=8 & :: Optional: set 8x8 raster font
inject getinput.dll

:: Then you can use all the variables GetInput module provides:
echo !mousexpos! !mouseypos! !wheeldelta!...

--- Discord RPC ---
set /a discordappid=0000000000000000000 &:: fill in your own obviously
set discordstate=Hello world
set discorddetails=Test
set discordlargeimg=big-img
set discordlargeimgtxt=Large image text
set discordsmallimg=small-img
set discordsmallimgtxt=Small image Test
inject discordrpc.dll
