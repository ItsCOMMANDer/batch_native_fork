Features
--------
- Mouse and keyboard polling
- Fast
- Easy to setup in existing or new projects
- Small size (~8k)

New available variables
-----------------------
keypressed*
click: left=1,right=2
wheeldelta: up=-1,down=1
mousexpos**
mouseypos**

* doesnt get cleared by getinput, set some flag or clear it manually to know that it was processed
** measured in characters

Setup
-----
:: Reset the variables
set /a mousexpos=mouseypos=keypressed=click=wheeldelta=0
getinput.exe

Then you can use all the variables GetInput provides:
echo !mousexpos! !mouseypos!...

Or see one of the examples (located at examples/ directory)

Notes
-----
getinput.exe returns different values on:
- Sucessful inject => 0
- Can't query parent process info => -3
- Parent process isn't cmd.exe => -2
  - This also makes MessageBox telling you
We don't support uppercase input
=> Uppercase keycodes get lowercased
- This is because getinput is mainly targetted for games
- For text input use set /p

System requirements
-------------------
OS:  Windows Vista x64 or better
CPU: SSE2 support
