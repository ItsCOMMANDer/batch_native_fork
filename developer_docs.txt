=== Internals of Batch Native ===
--- Injector ---
The injector is a small but important piece of code inside every new DLL. It handles hooking the dll into it's parent process, cmd.exe.
Using it is very simple. You just pop an `#include "Injector.h"` somewhere near the top of your source file and you're done. Then you can inject the dll from the command line like `rundll32 example.dll,inject`.
Before this new injection system, I had an external exe that would read from disk and inject the dll's into cmd.exe. This method allowed having compressed dlls, but was kinda broken.

--- GetInput ---
To grab the wheel delta, GetInput uses a global low-level mouse hook.

=== Creating a custom DLL ===
1. Create a copy of the Template directory in third_party_extensions and give it an appropriate name
2. In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, right click the "custom" folder and click Add->Existing project
3. Select the folder you copied and renamed earlier
4. Rename it inside visual studio too (right click->rename or F2)
5. Expand the project, expand source files and open dllmain.cpp ; Now you can edit your code
6. To build, just hit in top bar Build->Build [your_project_name_here] (CTRL-B) or build the entire solution ; Resulting binaries will be in [architecture]\[configuration] (for example x64\Release)
